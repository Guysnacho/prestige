## Dev notes

Helpful notes, for fresh eyes and for local development.

### Edge Functions

I'm using Supabase Edge Functions for serving up the map. Cached results, edge response times, and cheeeaaaaap.

#### Helpful CLI Commands

Deploy an edge function
`supabase functions deploy get-private-asset --project-ref`

### Protomaps Tiles

Protomaps comes with a pretty cool CLI. Makes life, map updates, and downloads easy.

#### Helpful CLI Commands

Show file details for a map bundle.
`pmtiles show https://build.protomaps.com/20230925.pmtiles`

Download a bundle using specified bounding boxes
`pmtiles.exe  extract https://build.protomaps.com/20240812.pmtiles my_area.pmtiles --bbox=-99.986572,31.212801,-79.365234,42.179688 --bbox=-99.986572,31.212801,-79.365234,42.179688`
